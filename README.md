# partialdockersave
This is a alternative of `docker save` which you can only save layers not exists in specified image.

* What's the purpose of this tool

Sometimes, we need to use `docker save` to dump the image and then transfer it to an enviroment without internet. We could have met a problem that the result filesize is always too big. 

In fact, we may already have an old image in the dest server which is much the same with new image. This tool help you to save only the layers that doesn't exist in the old images.
